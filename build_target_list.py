"""
OT Cyber Consulting Target List Builder.

Given a seed company/website and/or NAICS codes and industry keywords,
builds an expanded target-company list (primary/secondary/tertiary) for
job-search networking, using only free/keyless public data plus the
Anthropic API (with web search enabled) for research assistance.

Data sources:
  - SEC EDGAR (browse-edgar by SIC code) for real, verifiable PUBLIC
    company data — free, no key.
  - Claude API with the web_search tool, for NAICS expansion, private-
    company discovery, and qualitative enrichment. This requires the
    same ANTHROPIC_API_KEY used elsewhere; it is not a new paid service.

What this deliberately does NOT do:
  - No LinkedIn scraping. "Target executives" comes back as SUGGESTED
    TITLES/keywords to search yourself, never as scraped named
    individuals or scraped contact URLs.
  - No fabricated precision. Revenue/employee data is only presented as
    verified when it comes from SEC EDGAR; otherwise it's labeled as an
    AI estimate requiring your own verification, exactly like the
    original workbook's own "Sources + Caveats" convention.

Rules:
- Do not invent facts. If something can't be found, use null and say so via
  the confidence field rather than guessing silently.
- Revenue and employee count: if you are confident this is a public company
  with SEC filings, note that, but do NOT fabricate a specific dollar figure
  or headcount yourself — leave precise figures null (the pipeline fills
  verified figures from SEC EDGAR separately for public filers). For private
  companies, you may give a rough band (e.g. "$50M-$250M (estimate)") but
  MUST mark estimated fields with 'estimate' in the confidence field.
- "target_executive_titles" must be ROLE TITLES to search for (e.g. "VP
  Industrial Cybersecurity", "Director OT Security Practice"), never named
  individuals — this pipeline does not look up or report named executives.
- "linkedin_search_keywords" should be a short list of search terms/phrases
  useful for manually searching LinkedIn yourself.
- "currently_hiring_signal" should reflect what you can find via web search
  right now (careers page activity, recent job postings relevant to OT/
  cyber roles) — this is a fast-changing fact, so treat it as a snapshot at
  research time, not a stable attribute like HQ location.
- severity/priority fields should be your qualitative assessment, clearly
  that -- an assessment, not verified fact.
